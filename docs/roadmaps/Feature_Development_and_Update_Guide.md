# Feature Development Guide

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines for adding or updating features in the "Home App." It aims to ensure that all developers have a clear understanding of the project requirements, architecture, and existing resources.

## Understanding Requirements

### Identifying Needs
- **Feature Requests**: Process for receiving and documenting new feature requests.
  - **Checklist for Handling New Feature Requests**:
    1. **Verify Roadmap Alignment**: Ensure the feature aligns with the main roadmap. Update the roadmap if necessary.
    2. **Check for Sub-Roadmap**: Ensure a sub-roadmap exists; create one if necessary.
    3. **Specification Review**: Check for existing specifications; draft new ones if none exist.
    4. **Cross-Verification with Specifications**: Ensure the feature is reflected in both general and detailed specifications.
    5. **Stakeholder Confirmation**: Obtain approval from stakeholders, document feedback.
    6. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate existing resources for reuse and identify needs for new resources.
    7. **Update Documentation**: Update all related documentation to reflect the new feature.
    8. **Developer Briefing**: Hold a briefing session to review the checklist and specifications.
    9. **Feedback Loop Setup**: Establish a feedback mechanism for ongoing communication.
- **Requirement Gathering**: Techniques for detailed requirement gathering, including stakeholder interviews and user stories.

### Documentation
