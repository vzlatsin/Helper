# Feature Development Guide

## Introduction
This document provides guidelines for adding or updating features in the "Home App." It aims to ensure that all developers have a clear understanding of the project requirements, architecture, and existing resources.

## Understanding Requirements

### Identifying Needs
- **Feature Requests**: Process for receiving and documenting new feature requests.
  - **Checklist for Handling New Feature Requests**:
    1. **Verify Roadmap Alignment**: Ensure the feature aligns with the main roadmap. Update the roadmap if necessary.
    2. **Check for Sub-Roadmap**: Ensure a sub-roadmap exists; create one if necessary.
    3. **Specification Review**: Check for existing specifications; draft new ones if none exist.
    4. **Cross-Verification with Specifications**: Ensure the feature is reflected in both general and detailed specifications.
    5. **Stakeholder Confirmation**: Obtain approval from stakeholders, document feedback.
    6. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate existing resources for reuse and identify needs for new resources.
    7. **Update Documentation**: Update all related documentation to reflect the new feature.
    8. **Developer Briefing**: Hold a briefing session to review the checklist and specifications.
    9. **Feedback Loop Setup**: Establish a feedback mechanism for ongoing communication.
- **Requirement Gathering**: Techniques for detailed requirement gathering, including stakeholder interviews and user stories.

### Documentation
- **Spec Writing**: Guidelines for writing clear and detailed specifications.
- **Change Logs**: Maintaining logs of changes for feature updates.

## Project Structure

### Overview


The web application is structured to handle various tasks efficiently through distinct components, each serving a specific function. At the core, there's a user interface (UI) that users interact with. This UI is designed to be intuitive and provides forms and dashboards for users to input data and view information. Behind the scenes, thereâ€™s a server or an API that processes all the requests from the UI. It acts as the central command, managing interactions between the user interface, the database, and external services.

The database is a crucial component, storing all the necessary data such as trade details, dividend information, and user settings. It is set up to interact seamlessly with the server, ensuring that data is retrieved, stored, and updated efficiently as users interact with the application.

For fetching financial data, the application integrates with external services like Interactive Brokers through a feature known as Flex Query. This integration helps in pulling detailed financial reports directly into the app. Additionally, the application can connect to Gmail to automatically read and process emails, which is particularly useful for receiving notifications and updates directly through email.
