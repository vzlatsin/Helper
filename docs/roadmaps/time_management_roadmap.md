### Time Management Roadmap

#### Purpose and Vision
The time management component of the "Home App" aims to align daily activities with long-term goals by implementing effective time management principles inspired by "Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management" by Mark Forster. This feature will help prioritize tasks, clear backlogs, and plan for future actions, ensuring that daily routines contribute to achieving long-term objectives.

#### Key Features

1. **Closed Lists**:
   - Develop a feature that allows users to set a daily list of tasks at the start of each day. 
   - Prevent modification of the list during the day to promote focused work.

2. **Backlog Management**:
   - Implement a system for tracking backlog tasks, allowing users to categorize and prioritize them.
   - Create a scheduling system for systematically clearing the backlog.

3. **Scheduling for Tomorrow**:
   - Design a feature that prompts users to plan and schedule tasks for the next day.
   - Include reminders or notifications to encourage forward planning.

4. **Insights and Analysis**:
   - Create a dashboard to provide insights into how time is being spent.
   - Include visualizations to show how aligned daily activities are with long-term goals.
