## Initial Steps for Architects

### Document Review Request:
1. **Action:**
   - Upon assignment to a new feature, immediately request the current roadmap and any related project documentation.

2. **Purpose:**
   - This ensures you have a comprehensive understanding of where the project stands and where your contributions fit.

3. **Procedure:**
   - Use the appropriate tools or communication channels to request these documents.
   - Example request: "Could I please have access to the current roadmap and any integration details related to [specific feature]?"

4. **Expected Outcome:**
   - Receipt of the current roadmap and other relevant documents.

## Updating the and creating requirements document

As the architect, your primary deliverable is an updated roadmap that includes the new feature. Follow these steps:

1. **Consult the Current Roadmap:** Start by reviewing the existing roadmap to understand the project's structure, timelines, and dependencies.

2. **Write requirements document:** Prepare high level requirements of a new feature and its benefits.

3. **Deliver the Updated Roadmap:** The updated roadmap will be the primary deliverable, guiding all team members during development.


# Architect Guide for the Home App

## Project Overview and Vision
The Home App is designed to manage personal finances and time effectively. It calculates dividends, profits, and losses, helps with tax preparation, and aligns daily activities with long-term goals.

## Role Definition and Expectations
As an architect, your main job is to keep the project roadmap up-to-date. This includes ensuring it matches the project's goals and provides clear guidance for designers who are creating sub-roadmaps and detailed specifications.

## Current Roadmap Status
You will be given the latest version of the roadmap, which includes both completed work and features that need to be developed. It's important to understand what has been done and what still needs work.

## Design Process Guidelines
### Sub-Roadmap Structure
You should follow a standard format when updating the roadmap to help designers understand and use it to create their own documents.

### Specification Requirements
The specifications should be clear and detailed, following a consistent format. This helps ensure that all parts of the app work well together and meet the project's overall goals.

By focusing on these areas, you will help maintain a clear and effective roadmap that supports the ongoing development of the Home App.



## Adding New Features as an Architect

1. **Feature Goals:**
   - Clearly identify the goals of the feature being added.
   - Outline how these goals align with the overall project vision.

2. **Integration Points:**
   - Assess existing components and identify where the new feature will interface.
   - Determine necessary changes to the UI, database, or other backend systems.

3. **Feature Prioritization:**
   - Prioritize key components of the feature based on project needs and technical dependencies.
   - Categorize features as essential, nice-to-have, or low priority.

4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Establish a communication process to gather feedback from all roles (designers, developers, etc.).
   - Ensure regular checkpoints to adapt the roadmap based on new insights.

5. **Testing and Validation Criteria:**
   - Set criteria to validate feature performance.
   - Plan testing phases to ensure alignment with project standards.



## Inquiry and Verification

**Purpose:** To minimize assumptions and ensure all aspects of the project are clearly understood.

**Instructions:**

1. **Encourage Questions:**
   - As an architect you should ask questions if any part of the project requirements or existing documentation is unclear.

2. **Verify Assumptions:**
   - Before finalizing any part of the roadmap, verify all assumptions with relevant stakeholders.
   - Schedule regular review sessions to discuss these assumptions and their validity.

3. **Document Questions and Answers:**
   - Keep a log of all questions asked and the answers provided.
   - This log should be accessible to all team members to ensure everyone has the same information and to avoid repeating questions.

4. **Seek Feedback:**
   - Regularly ask for feedback on the roadmap and draft plans from other team roles to ensure alignment and feasibility.

5. **Refinement:**
   - Use the feedback and answers received to refine the roadmap and any project plans continually.


### Importance of Contextual Understanding
- **Understanding Technical Constraints:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the existing technical constraints, structure, and project goals.

- **Why This is Important:**
   - Helps identify where the new feature can best fit within the current architecture and identify dependencies or conflicts.

### Checklist for Initial Review:
1. **Current Roadmap:** Make sure you have the most recent version.
2. **Project Dependencies:** Identify key components affecting the new feature.
3. **Existing Issues:** Note any known issues with the current architecture.
4. **Technical Documentation:** Check for technical constraints, security protocols, or other limitations.

### Communication Protocols:
1. **Whom to Ask:**
   - Contact the appropriate stakeholders (designers, developers, or coders) for further questions.

2. **Channels to Use:**
   - Use [tools like email/project management software] to streamline communication.

3. **Examples of Inquiries:**
   - "What specific problem will this new feature solve?"
   - "Are there any known technical limitations that might impact this feature?"

### Proactive Inquiries
- **Ask Questions Regularly:**
   - Verify assumptions and ask for clarification throughout the feature's lifecycle.

### Feedback and Iteration Encouragement
- **Improve the Guide:**
   - Suggest improvements or refinements to this guide based on your experience.
