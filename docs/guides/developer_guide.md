**Outputs**:
1. **Pseudocode**:
   - Detailed logical representation of the code.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/developer/pseudocode_new_feature.md`
2. **Script Instructions**:
   - Detailed instructions for coding, covering all aspects of the implementation.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/developer/script_instructions.md`
3. **HTML Structure Plan**:
   - Plan for the HTML structure and any changes needed.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/developer/html_structure_plan.md`
4. **Code Changes**:
   - Specific details on the changes to be made in the codebase.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/developer/code_changes.md`
5. **Data Flow and Interaction Guidelines**:
   - Detailed guidelines on data flow and user interactions.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/developer/data_flow_interaction.md`

**Process**  
1. **Familiarize with Current Codebase**:
   - **Action**: Explore the project structure by reviewing the codebase on the project's GitHub repository.
   - **Focus Areas**: 
     - `app_async.py`: Main application logic.
     - `helper.py`: Utility functions.
     - `templates` directory: HTML structures.

2. **Confirm Understanding of Code Structure**:
   - **Action**: Review the code structure and hierarchy to ensure you understand it.
   - **Outcome Expected**: A clear understanding of where changes should be made.

3. **Access Latest Design Deliverables and Guidelines**:
   - **Action**: Access the design deliverables, coding guidelines, and existing HTML structures.
   - **Where to Find**: 
     - `docs/[feature_name]/designer/specifications.md`
     - HTML structures in `templates`

4. **Analyze Design and Identify Dependencies**:
   - **Action**: Analyze design deliverables to identify dependencies and requirements.
   - **Details**: Note data structures, flow requirements, and existing components.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Clear understanding of the design and its interaction with existing features.

5. **Create a New Folder for the Feature**:
   - **Action**: Create a new folder in the `docs/developer` directory for the new feature's deliverables.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Organized structure for documents and code changes related to the new feature.

6. **Document Code Changes**:
   - **Action**: Create detailed documents for each script that needs to be changed or added.
   - **Files to Include**: 
     - `pseudocode_new_feature.md`: Pseudocode and logic.
     - `html_structure_plan.md`: HTML structure plan.
     - `code_changes.md`: Specific script changes.
     - `data_flow_interaction.md`: Data flow and interaction guidelines.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Clear instructions for the coder to implement the new feature.

7. **Develop Pseudocode**:
   - **Action**: Write pseudocode outlining the backend logic for the new feature.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Provide a clear, structured plan for implementing the new functionality.

8. **Plan HTML Structure**:
   - **Action**: Extend the current HTML templates to incorporate sections for the new feature.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Ensure seamless integration with existing HTML structures.

9. **Create Data Flow and Interaction Guidelines**:
   - **Action**: Document the flow of data between the backend and frontend.
   - **Details**: Outline user interactions and their effect on the task lists.
   - **Outcome Expected**: Provide a comprehensive guide for the coder to follow.

10. **Final Review and Adjustments**:
    - **Action**: Review all documents and make necessary adjustments before handing them off to the coder.
    - **Outcome Expected**: Ensure completeness, consistency, and accuracy in documentation.

**Consistency Checks**:
1. **Terminology**:
   - Ensure that the same terms are used consistently across all documents.
   - Create a glossary of terms if necessary.

2. **Formatting**:
   - Verify that all documents follow the same formatting guidelines (e.g., headings, bullet points, numbering).
   - Use standardized templates for all documents.

3. **Style**:
   - Ensure a consistent writing style (e.g., tone, tense) across all documents.
   - Follow a style guide to maintain uniformity.

4. **Review Process**:
   - Implement a review process to check for consistency before deliverables are passed to the coder.
   - Have another team member or auditor review the documents.

**Review Checklist for Auditor**  
1. **Clarity**: Ensure the deliverables are clear and understandable for the coder.
2. **Completeness**: Check that all necessary components are included.
3. **Relevance**: Confirm the deliverables are directly useful to the coder.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure documentation is uniform in terminology, format, and style.
5. **Feasibility**: Assess the realism and technical feasibility of the pseudocode and script instructions.

**Feedback and Iteration**  
- Ensure deliverables include room for feedback and iteration.
- Define procedures for handling incomplete or unclear inputs.
