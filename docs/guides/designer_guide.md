3. **Feature Description**: Comprehensive overview of the feature.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/architect/feature_description.md`
4. **Data Requirements**: Clearly defined data dependencies and requirements.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/architect/data_requirements.md`
5. **Roadmap**: High-level overview of project phases and milestones.
   - **Location**: `docs/roadmap.md`

**Outputs**:
1. **Sub-roadmaps**:
   - Detailed plans breaking down the project phases, **including specific programming tasks and implementation steps**.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/designer/sub_roadmaps.md`
2. **Specifications**:
   - Detailed design specifications including all necessary design details and **implementation steps**.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/designer/specifications.md`

**Process**
1. **Gather Inputs**:
   - **Sources**: Requirements document, user stories, feature description, data requirements, roadmap.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the feature.
2. **Create Design Deliverables**:
   - **Sub-roadmaps**: Break down the project phases into specific tasks and steps.
     - **Expected Details**:
       - Clear definition of tasks and sub-tasks.
       - Step-by-step implementation instructions for each task.
       - Specific details on database schema design, API endpoints, frontend components, testing, and documentation.
       - Inclusion of dependencies and order of execution.
   - **Specifications**: Detailed design documents outlining all necessary implementation steps.
3. **Ensure Clarity**:
   - **Objective**: Make sure all deliverables are clear and understandable.
   - **Method**: Use diagrams, flowcharts, and clear explanations.
4. **Review Process**:
   - **Objective**: Check for consistency and completeness.
   - **Method**: Have another team member or auditor review the documents.

**Review Checklist for Auditor**
1. **Clarity**: Ensure the deliverables are clear and understandable for the developer.
2. **Completeness**: Check that all necessary components are included, **including specific programming tasks**.
3. **Relevance**: Confirm the deliverables are directly useful to the developer.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure documentation is uniform in terminology, format, and style.
5. **Feasibility**: Assess the realism and technical feasibility of the design.

**Feedback and Iteration**
- Ensure deliverables include room for feedback and iteration.
- Define procedures for handling incomplete or unclear inputs.

### Example Sub-roadmap for Time Management Feature

```markdown
## Task 1: Set Up Project Structure
- **Step 1**: Initialize a new Python project.
  - **Details**: Create a new project directory, initialize a Git repository.
- **Step 2**: Set up a virtual environment.
  - **Details**: Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment.
- **Step 3**: Install required packages.
  - **Details**: Install packages such as Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended using `pip`.

## Task 2: Design Database Schema
- **Step 1**: Define tables for tasks, lists, and reminders.
  - **Details**: Create tables:
    - `Tasks`: Fields for `id`, `name`, `description`, `due_date`, `status`, `list_id`
    - `Lists`: Fields for `id`, `name`, `is_closed`
    - `Reminders`: Fields for `id`, `task_id`, `reminder_time`
- **Step 2**: Create relationships between tables.
  - **Details**: Define foreign key relationships:
    - `Tasks` to `Lists` (one-to-many)
    - `Reminders` to `Tasks` (one-to-one)
- **Step 3**: Implement migrations.
  - **Details**: Use `Alembic` to create and apply database migrations.

## Task 3: Develop API Endpoints
- **Step 1**: Create endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
  - **Details**:
    - POST `/tasks`: Create a new task
    - GET `/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks
    - GET `/tasks/<id>`: Retrieve a specific task
    - PUT `/tasks/<id>`: Update a specific task
    - DELETE `/tasks/<id>`: Delete a specific task
- **Step 2**: Create endpoints for managing lists.
  - **Details**:
    - POST `/lists`: Create a new list
    - GET `/lists`: Retrieve all lists
    - GET `/lists/<id>`: Retrieve a specific list
    - PUT `/lists/<id>`: Update a specific list (including closing it)
    - DELETE `/lists/<id>`: Delete a specific list
- **Step 3**: Create endpoints for reminders and notifications.
  - **Details**:
    - POST `/reminders`: Create a new reminder
    - GET `/reminders`: Retrieve all reminders
