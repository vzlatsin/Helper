**Outputs**:
1. **Implemented Code**:
   - Code that follows the developer's specifications.
   - **Location**: `src/[feature_name]/`
2. **Test Results**:
   - Comprehensive testing results covering all use cases.
   - **Location**: `tests/[feature_name]/`
3. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed documentation of the implemented code and its usage.
   - **Location**: `docs/[feature_name]/coder/`

**Process**  
1. **Gather Inputs**:
   - **Sources**: Pseudocode, script instructions, HTML structure plans, and data flow guidelines from the developer.

2. **Write Code**:
   - Implement the code following the provided instructions.
   - Ensure the code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to best practices.

3. **Test and Validate**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the code functions correctly.
   - Validate the code against the specified requirements and acceptance criteria.

**Documentation Standards**:
1. **Implemented Code**:
   - **Format**: Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to best practices.
   - **Guidelines**:
     - Use meaningful variable names.
     - Include comments explaining the purpose of complex sections.
     - Follow consistent indentation and coding style.

2. **Test Results**:
   - **Format**: Use a standardized template with sections for test cases, expected results, and actual results.
   - **Template**:
     ```markdown
     ## Test Results for [Feature Name]
     ### Test Case 1
     - **Description**: Describe the test case.
     - **Expected Result**: Describe the expected outcome.
     - **Actual Result**: Describe the actual outcome.
     - **Status**: Pass/Fail
     ### Test Case 2
     - **Description**: Describe the test case.
     - **Expected Result**: Describe the expected outcome.
     - **Actual Result**: Describe the actual outcome.
     - **Status**: Pass/Fail
     ```

3. **Documentation**:
   - **Format**: Use a clear hierarchical structure with section headings.
   - **Template**:
     ```markdown
     ## Documentation for [Feature Name]
     ### Overview
     - Brief overview of the implemented code.
     ### Usage Instructions
     - Detailed instructions on how to use the code.
     ### Examples
     - Provide examples of usage.
     ### Code Walkthrough
     - Step-by-step explanation of the code.
     ```

**Consistency Checks**:
1. **Terminology**:
   - Ensure that the same terms are used consistently across all code and documentation.
   - Create a glossary of terms if necessary.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Glossary
     - **Function**: A block of code designed to perform a particular task.
     - **Variable**: A named space in memory to store data.
     ```

2. **Formatting**:
   - Verify that all code and documentation follow the same formatting guidelines (e.g., indentation, comments, headings, bullet points).
   - Use standardized templates for all documentation.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Formatting Guidelines
     - Use `#` for main headings.
     - Use `##` for subheadings.
     - Use `-` for bullet points.
     - Use `1.` for numbered lists.
     ```

3. **Style**:
   - Ensure a consistent writing style (e.g., tone, tense) across all documentation.
   - Follow a coding style guide to maintain uniformity.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Style Guide
     - Use meaningful variable names.
     - Write comments in the present tense.
     - Use clear and concise language.
     ```

4. **Review Process**:
   - Implement a review process to check for consistency before finalizing deliverables.
   - Have another team member or auditor review the code and documentation.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Review Checklist
     - Check for consistent terminology.
     - Verify formatting guidelines are followed.
     - Ensure the writing style is uniform.
     - Have code and documentation reviewed by a peer or auditor.
     ```

**Review Checklist for Auditor**  
1. **Clarity**: Ensure the code and documentation are clear and understandable.
2. **Completeness**: Check that all necessary components are included.
3. **Relevance**: Confirm the code meets the developer's specifications.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure the code and documentation are uniform in style and format.
5. **Functionality**: Assess the correctness and performance of the code.

**Feedback and Iteration**  
- Ensure deliverables include room for feedback and iteration.
- Define procedures for handling incomplete or unclear inputs.

This guide ensures that the coder’s outputs are well-defined and meet the developer’s specifications, facilitating a smooth transition and effective workflow.

### Next Steps:
- Review the integrated changes to ensure they meet your expectations.
- Identify any additional improvements or adjustments needed before finalizing the guide.
