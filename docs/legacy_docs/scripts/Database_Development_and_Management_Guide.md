# Database Development and Management Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the database architecture, setup procedures, and interaction patterns within our project. It aims to serve as a reference for developers and database administrators to ensure consistent practices in database management and data access.

## Database Setup

### Initial Configuration

Our project utilizes SQLite, a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process. It's ideal for projects requiring simplicity and minimal setup.

- **Script**: `init_db.py`
- **Functionality**: Establishes a database connection, creates tables based on provided SQL statements.

### Connection Establishment

Both `init_db.py` and `data_access.py` contain the `create_connection` function, demonstrating the standard method to initiate a connection to the SQLite database.

```python
def create_connection(db_file):
    """Create a database connection to the SQLite database specified by db_file"""
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(e)
    return conn
```

### Table Creation

The `init_db.py` script outlines the process for creating database tables. This involves executing SQL statements that define the table schema.

```python
def create_table(conn, create_table_sql):
    """Create a table from the create_table_sql statement"""
    try:
        c = conn.cursor()
        c.execute(create_table_sql)
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(e)
```

## Data Access Patterns

### `data_access.py`

This script encapsulates the operations for inserting and querying data, abstracting the database interaction complexities.

#### Inserting Data

Example function to insert dividend data:

```python
def insert_dividend(conn, symbol, amount, ex_date, pay_date):
    """
    Insert a new dividend into the dividends table
    """
    # SQL command and execution details omitted for brevity
```

This pattern is replicated across various functions tailored to specific data types, such as dividends, trades, etc.

Based on the summaries extracted from the relevant sections of "the book," it appears that while there's a brief mention of handling trade data in real-time, the details on the database development, management guide, and setup are not extensively covered in the provided excerpts. Therefore, to fill these gaps and enhance the documentation for Phase 1 development, here are the sections you should consider adding or expanding:

### Understanding the Database Schema

The application's database is structured to efficiently store and manage data related to securities trading. Key tables include:

- `trades`: Stores individual trade transactions. Important columns include `trade_id` (primary key), `security_id` (references securities), `trade_type` (buy or sell), `quantity`, `price`, and `trade_date`.

- `dividends`: Captures dividend payments for securities. Columns include `id` (primary key), `symbol` (identifies the security), `amount` (dividend amount), `ex_date` (the ex-dividend date), and `pay_date` (the payment date).


### Table Creation Scripts

To initialize the database, the following SQL scripts are used to create the essential tables:

```sql
-- Creation of the trades table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trades (
    trade_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    security_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    trade_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    trade_date TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Creation of the dividends table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dividends (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount REAL NOT NULL,
    ex_date TEXT NOT NULL,
    pay_date TEXT NOT NULL
);


### Key Fields and Their Roles

In managing and processing trade data in real-time, specific fields play critical roles:

- `trade_id`: Uniquely identifies each trade, allowing for precise tracking and querying of transactions.
- `security_id` and `symbol`: Identify the traded security, crucial for correlating trades with securities and their dividends.
- `trade_type`, `quantity`, and `price`: Essential for calculating the volume and value of trades, which are critical inputs for profit/loss analysis.

This structured approach to data management facilitates efficient and accurate real-time processing of trade information, supporting dynamic updates and analysis within the application.

## Best Practices

### Error Handling

Both scripts demonstrate basic error handling practices, catching exceptions related to database connections and operations, ensuring robustness.

### Logging

While not explicitly shown in the provided scripts, incorporating logging, especially for database operations, is recommended to aid in debugging and monitoring.

## Security Considerations

The scripts utilize parameterized queries, mitigating risks associated with SQL injection. This practice should be maintained and extended across all database interactions.

## Conclusion

This guide outlines the foundational aspects of database management within our project. Developers are encouraged to follow the outlined practices for consistency and efficiency.
