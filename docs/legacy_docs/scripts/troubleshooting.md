# Simple Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fixes

If you see "Error connecting to the server. Please try again," try these steps:

1. **Check Your Internet**: Make sure your internet is working. Try opening a website to see if it loads.
2. **Restart Your App**: Sometimes, simply restarting the application can fix connection issues.
3. **Look at the Logs**: If the problem persists, look at the application logs for errors. These are usually found in a log file within the app's folder.

## Where to Find Logs

- **Logs Folder**: Look in the app's folder for a subfolder named `logs` or a file that ends with `.log`.

## Reading Logs

- When you open the log file, look for lines that say "ERROR" or "WARNING" near the time when you encountered the problem.
- These lines can give clues about what went wrong.

## If All Else Fails

- **Restart Your Computer**: Sometimes, the issue might not be with the app itself but with your computer. A restart can often clear up underlying issues.
- **Check for Updates**: Make sure your app and your computer's operating system are up to date. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions.
