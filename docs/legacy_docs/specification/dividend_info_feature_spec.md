# Load Dividend Information Feature Specification

## Feature Goal
The goal is to provide users with up-to-date dividend information, enabling them to make informed investment decisions by understanding the value and performance of their investments through timely dividend data.

## Integration Points
- **Data Access Module (`data-access`):** For database interactions related to dividends.
- **Async Application Module (`app_async`):** Leveraging the asynchronous core for real-time data fetching.
- **Flex Query Module:** For external financial data retrieval.

## Development Steps

### Data Handling
1. **Data Fetching:**
   - Implement `initiate_dividend_query()` in the Flex Query module to start a dividend-specific Flex Query.
   - Use `RequestHandler.get` for API calls to financial data sources.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Parse fetched data with `parse_xml_response`, extracting dividend details.
   - Add functions in Data Access for storing dividend data, ensuring no duplicates.

3. **Data Display:**
   - Implement `get_dividend_info()` in Data Access for user-friendly data retrieval.
   - Support filtering by criteria like symbol and date.

### User Journey
1. **Accessing Information:**
   - Introduce a new route in `app_async.py` (`/dividends`) for dividend info display.
   - Create a front-end search component for dividends by symbols or dates.

2. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Use SocketIO in `app_async.py` for live dividend data updates.

3. **Interaction and Feedback:**
   - Develop UI components for requesting the latest dividend data.
   - Offer visual feedback during data fetching and processing.

## Simplification Strategy
Each step is crafted for clarity and direct action, with specific technologies and terms mentioned for focused development.

## Modular Approach
Adopt a modular design for each component of data handling and user interaction, enabling isolated development, testing, and debugging.
