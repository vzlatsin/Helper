### Project Specification: Email Automation Integration

#### Objective
Integrate an automated system for fetching and processing PDF reports from emails sent by Interactive Brokers, incorporating the functionality into the existing trade and financial data management system.

#### Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, google-api-python-client, pytest (for testing)
- **APIs**: Gmail API
- **Database**: SQLite

#### Development Breakdown

**Step 1: Gmail API Setup**
- **Task**: Configure the Google Cloud project to use the Gmail API and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials.
- **Output**: `credentials.json` for API access, and `token.json` for storing user tokens.
- **Tests**:
  - Test API connection failure and recovery.
  - Test successful authentication and token refresh.

**Step 2: Email Fetching Module (`email_fetcher.py`)**
- **Task**: Implement a module to fetch emails based on specific criteria (sender, subject).
- **Output**: List of emails with PDF attachments.
- **Tests**:
  - Test fetching emails without attachments.
  - Test fetching non-Interactive Brokers emails to ensure they are excluded.

**Step 3: PDF Extraction and Parsing**
- **Task**: Extend `email_fetcher.py` to extract PDF attachments and parse them to structured data.
- **Output**: Structured trade data ready for database insertion.
- **Tests**:
  - Test extraction of multiple PDF attachments.
  - Test parsing of PDFs to ensure correct data structuring.
  - Test handling of corrupted or unreadable PDF files.

**Step 4: Data Access Layer Integration**
- **Task**: Create and integrate functions in `data_access` module for inserting parsed data into the database.
- **Output**: Data inserted into the SQLite database, avoiding duplicates.
- **Tests**:
  - Test database insertion with mock data.
  - Test for handling of duplicate data to prevent redundant entries.

**Step 5: Asynchronous Processing Using Flask-SocketIO**
- **Task**: Implement asynchronous operations for processing emails and updating the user interface in real-time.
- **Output**: Non-blocking email processing and real-time UI updates.
- **Tests**:
  - Test the async processing of large PDF files.
  - Test real-time feedback mechanism to the UI.

**Step 6: Security and Error Handling Enhancements**
- **Task**: Implement security best practices and robust error handling for new functionalities.
- **Output**: Secure and reliable email fetching and processing system.
- **Tests**:
  - Test security measures like input validation.
  - Test error handling for various failure scenarios in email processing and PDF parsing.

**Step 7: Documentation and Deployment**
- **Task**: Document the entire development process, setup, and usage instructions.
- **Output**: Updated project documentation and deployment on the production environment.
- **Tests**:
  - Test the deployment process in a controlled environment.
  - Test the complete system after deployment to ensure operational integrity.
