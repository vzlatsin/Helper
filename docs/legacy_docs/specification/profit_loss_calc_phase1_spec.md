### Phase 1 Specification: Database Query Development for Security Position Profit/Loss Calculation

#### Objective
To develop SQL queries and supporting Python functions for efficiently extracting all relevant trade data for specified securities, including stock and options trades from an SQLite database.

#### Database Schema
(Note: This section assumes a generic schema. Adjust according to your actual schema details.)

Tables involved:
- `trades`: Stores details of each trade.
  - `trade_id` (INTEGER): Unique identifier for the trade.
  - `symbol` (TEXT): Stock symbol.
  - `trade_type` (TEXT): Indicates if the trade is for stock or options.
  - `quantity` (INTEGER): Number of shares/options traded.
  - `price` (REAL): Trade price.
  - `trade_direction` (TEXT): Indicates buy or sell.
  - `trade_date` (TEXT): Date of the trade.

#### Required SQL Queries

1. **Select Trades by Symbol**:
   - Fetch all trades for a given symbol, including both stocks and options.
   - Sort by `trade_date` to facilitate chronological processing.

```sql
SELECT * FROM trades WHERE symbol = ? ORDER BY trade_date ASC;
```

#### Python Implementation

1. **Database Connection**:
   - Utilize the `create_connection` function from `data_access.py` to establish a connection to the database.

2. **Execute Query**:
   - Implement a new function in `data_access.py` to execute the SQL query with parameter binding to avoid SQL injection.

```python
def get_trades_by_symbol(conn, symbol):
    """
    Query trades by symbol.
    :param conn: the Connection object
    :param symbol: stock symbol to query for
    :return: a list of tuples containing the trade data
    """
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM trades WHERE symbol = ? ORDER BY trade_date ASC", (symbol,))
    return cur.fetchall()
```


### Phase 1 Specification: Test Cases

#### 1. Test for Correct Data Retrieval by Symbol
- **Objective**: Ensure the query correctly retrieves all trades for a given symbol, including both stocks and options.
- **Description**: This test should mock or use a controlled test database environment to insert a predefined set of trades for multiple symbols. The test then executes the `get_trades_by_symbol` function for a specific symbol and verifies that only trades for that symbol are returned, and all trade types (stock and options) are included.
- **Expected Outcome**: The function returns the exact set of trades inserted for the tested symbol, with no missing or extra records.

#### 2. Test for Correct Ordering by Trade Date
- **Objective**: Validate that the trades are returned in ascending order by trade date.
- **Description**: Utilizing the same setup as the first test, this test focuses on the order of the returned trades. It checks that the trades are sorted correctly by the `trade_date` field, from oldest to newest.
- **Expected Outcome**: Trades are returned in the correct chronological order.

#### 3. Test for Empty Result with Unknown Symbol
- **Objective**: Confirm that querying an unknown or non-existent symbol returns an empty result, not an error.
- **Description**: Run the `get_trades_by_symbol` function with a symbol that does not exist in the test database. This test ensures that the system handles such cases gracefully.
- **Expected Outcome**: The function returns an empty list, and no exceptions are thrown.

#### 4. Test for SQL Injection Prevention
- **Objective**: Ensure the query is resistant to SQL injection attacks.
- **Description**: Attempt to execute the `get_trades_by_symbol` function with input that includes SQL injection techniques (e.g., adding `' OR '1'='1` to the symbol name). This test is crucial for security.
- **Expected Outcome**: The function safely handles the input without altering the database or returning unauthorized data. Ideally, it should return an empty list or the results for a literal interpretation of the input symbol.

#### Implementation Notes for Developers:
- **Mocking Database Connections**: For unit tests, mock the database connection to avoid interactions with the actual database. This approach isolates the test environment and ensures no side effects.
- **Using Test Databases**: For integration tests, use a separate test database pre-populated with known data that allows for the expected outcomes to be defined.
- **Security Testing**: For the SQL injection test, it's critical to verify that parameterized queries or other safe query construction methods are used to prevent injection.

### Conclusion (tests)
Including these test cases in the Phase 1 spec provides a clear roadmap for developers to validate the newly developed functionality. By ensuring that these tests are passed, the developer (or AI) can confidently proceed, knowing that the core database interactions for the profit/loss calculation feature are correctly implemented and secure.

### Conclusion
This specification provides detailed guidance on developing the database query functionality needed for Phase 1 of the security position profit/loss calculation feature. It outlines the SQL queries, Python implementation, testing criteria, and security considerations necessary for developers to proceed with implementation.
