# Profit/Loss Calculation for Security Positions Specification

## Objective

Develop and integrate functionality to calculate the profit or loss on positions for a specified security (e.g., NEM stock), including both stock and options trades, by extracting relevant trade data from the database.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Database Query Development

- **Objective**: Craft SQL queries to efficiently extract all relevant trades for the specified security, including distinguishing between stock and options trades.
- **Details**:
  - Define SQL queries to select trades where `symbol` matches the specified security and `trade_type` includes both 'stock' and 'option'.
  - Ensure the query retrieves essential details for profit/loss calculation, such as `trade_direction`, `quantity`, `price`, and transaction date.
- **Testing**: Verify query correctness and performance using a subset of production-equivalent data.

### Phase 2: Calculation Logic Implementation

- **Objective**: Implement the logic to calculate the profit or loss from the extracted trade data, accounting for the differing nature of stock and options trades.
- **Details**:
  - Develop a method to process the retrieved trade data, grouping trades by `trade_type`.
  - Calculate profit/loss for stocks by comparing buy and sell transactions.
  - Handle options trades by considering premiums and, if applicable, exercise prices.
  - Ensure the calculation method handles edge cases, such as partial fills and corporate actions (if relevant).
- **Testing**: Unit tests to cover various scenarios, including only buys, only sells, mixed transactions, and options exercises.

### Phase 3: User Interface Integration

- **Objective**: Provide a user interface for selecting a security and displaying the calculated profit/loss.
- **Details**:
  - Develop a simple form or selection interface for users to input or select a security symbol.
  - Display the calculated profit/loss in a user-friendly format, detailing the contributions from stocks and options separately.
- **Testing**: User acceptance testing to validate the interface's ease of use and the accuracy of displayed calculations.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Training

- **Objective**: Document the new functionality and train staff on its use.
- **Details**:
  - Compile comprehensive documentation outlining the feature's purpose, use cases, and step-by-step instructions for use.
  - Conduct training sessions for relevant staff, focusing on interpreting the profit/loss calculations and troubleshooting common issues.
- **Testing**: Gather feedback from staff to refine the documentation and training materials.

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Alerts**: Implement functionality to trigger alerts for significant profit or loss thresholds.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate advanced analytical tools for deeper insights into trading patterns and performance.
