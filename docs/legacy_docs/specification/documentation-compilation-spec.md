# Documentation Compilation Feature Specification - Iterative Approach

## Phase 1: Initial Integration and Manual Trigger
- **Objective**: Integrate a preliminary script into the web application that manually concatenates Markdown files from `docs/` and `docs/scripts/`.
- **Testing**: Ensure the script can be triggered and executes within the web application environment, concatenating files into a single Markdown document.

## Phase 2: File Discovery and Dynamic Concatenation
- **Objective**: Enhance the script to dynamically discover and list Markdown files, then concatenate them in a specified order.
- **Testing**: Verify dynamic file discovery and correct order of concatenation through manual script activation.

## Phase 3: Advanced Formatting and Table of Contents
- **Objective**: Implement advanced formatting, including a dynamically generated table of contents based on file names or headings within the Markdown files.
- **Testing**: Check for accurate table of contents generation and overall document formatting.

## Phase 4: Export Options and User Interface
- **Objective**: Provide export options for the combined document (Markdown and PDF) and develop a CLI or web interface for easy feature activation.
- **Testing**: Test export functionality and interface usability, confirming correct document generation and format.

## Phase 5: Full Integration and Automated Testing
- **Objective**: Fully integrate the feature into the web application with options for scheduled or event-driven document compilation. Implement automated testing for reliability and efficiency.
- **Testing**: Conduct comprehensive integration and automated tests to ensure feature stability and performance within the web application.

## Documentation and Finalization
- Update the project `README.md` with information on the new feature.
- Create detailed documentation in `docs/specification/` for future reference and development continuity.
