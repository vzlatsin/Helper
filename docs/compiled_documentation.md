# Async Application Documentation

## Overview

This document describes `app_async.py`, the core of the asynchronous web application, leveraging Flask and Flask-SocketIO for real-time web communication and async processing.

## Setup

The script initializes a Flask app with CORS enabled, configures it with default and external settings, and sets up Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication.

## Key Components

- **Flask Application**: Configuration details, including testing and debug modes.
- **SocketIO Integration**: How SocketIO is integrated for real-time updates.
- **Async Routes**: Examples of asynchronous route definitions.
- **Background Tasks**: Utilization of `socketio.start_background_task` for async operations.

## Routes

- `/async-route`: Demonstrates an async response from a Flask route.
- `/fetch-financial-data-async`: Shows a form template for initiating financial data fetching.

## Event Handlers

- `fetch_dividends`: Triggered by a client request to start fetching and processing dividend data asynchronously.

## Background Processing

Details on processing dividends in the background, ensuring non-blocking operations while providing real-time updates to the client.

## Error Handling

Explanation of error handling within async tasks and routes, ensuring robust application behavior.

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for expanding async capabilities and improving real-time feedback mechanisms.



# Data Access Documentation

This module manages database operations for financial data, including inserting new records and querying data.

## Functions Overview

- **create_connection(db_file)**: Establishes a database connection.
- **insert_dividend(conn, symbol, amount, ex_date, pay_date)**: Inserts a new dividend record.
- **insert_dividend_if_not_exists(conn, symbol, amount, ex_date, pay_date)**: Ensures no duplicate records are inserted.
- **count_dividend_records(conn)**: Counts total dividend records.
- **get_latest_dividend_date(conn)**: Retrieves the latest dividend date.
- **fetch_dividends_from_db(conn)**: Fetches all dividend records.
- **fetch_dividends_by_quarter(conn)**: Aggregates dividends by quarter.

## Example Usage

Provides steps for connecting to the database, inserting records, and querying existing data.

## Tips for New Developers

Highlights the importance of SQLite installation and SQL syntax familiarity.

## Future Improvements

Discusses transitioning to asynchronous database operations and advanced data analysis queries.


# Flex Query Documentation

This module is responsible for fetching financial data through Flex Query API calls, including initiating and downloading Flex Query reports.

## Functions Overview

- **parse_xml_response(response_text)**: Parses XML response strings.
- **RequestHandler.get(url, params)**: Manages GET requests with given URL and parameters.
- **initiate_flex_query_report(query_id, token, request_handler=None)**: Initiates Flex Query report process.
- **download_flex_query_report(reference_code, token, retry_attempts, retry_wait, request_handler=None)**: Downloads the Flex Query report with retry logic.

## Example Usage

Demonstrate how to fetch and process financial reports by initiating and downloading a Flex Query report.

## Error Handling

Describes error logging during request failures or XML parsing issues for easier troubleshooting.

## Future Enhancements

Suggestions for implementing asynchronous request handling and enhancing error recovery mechanisms.


# Running the Application

## Overview
`run.py` serves as the entry point for running the Flask web application. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous modes, determined by command-line input.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt`

## Configuration
The script uses the `MY_APP_ENV` environment variable to determine the application's configuration mode (`development`, `production`, etc.). Configurations are loaded from corresponding JSON files within the `config` directory.

## Logging
Logging is configured according to the loaded configuration, specifying log files, levels, and formats.

## Usage
To run the application:
- For synchronous mode: `python run.py`
- For asynchronous mode: `python run.py async`

## Environment Variables
- `MY_APP_ENV`: Determines the app's running environment.
- `APP_SETTINGS`: Set by the script to match `MY_APP_ENV`.

## Command-Line Arguments
- `async`: Specifies that the app should run in asynchronous mode.

## Code Snippets
(Provide relevant code snippets for configuration loading and app initialization)

## Troubleshooting
(Include common issues and resolutions)
