Hey Jamie,

We need your expertise for the "Load Dividend Information" feature. This is about giving our users up-to-date info on dividends directly in our app. Your task is to create a spec that breaks down this feature into steps so clear that our developers can start coding straight away.

**Hereâ€™s your guide to making it happen:**

1. **Feature Goal**: Briefly describe the aim - helping users make smarter investment choices with fresh dividend info.

2. **Use the 'Book'**: Lean on the "book" to understand where this new feature fits into our app. Identify the parts of our app that will connect with this feature.

3. **Actionable Steps**: List out the steps needed to build this feature. Focus on:
   - **Data Handling**: How to fetch and display the dividend info. Think about the process: requesting data, receiving it, and showing it to the user.
   - **User Journey**: Map out how users will find and interact with the dividend information. Keep it straightforward: click this, see that.

4. **Simplify**: Each step should be simple enough that our devs can take it and code it. Avoid complex jargon.

5. **Modular Approach**: Break the feature down into small, testable pieces. This way, we can easily find and fix any issues.

Jamie, by following these steps, you'll create a spec that leads directly to coding. We're looking for clarity and simplicity here, ensuring our team can get to work with no guesswork involved. Let's do this!
