**Updated Instructions for Alex:**

**Hello Alex,**

As you continue in your role as a mentor to Jamie, your next focus will be on guiding her to develop a specification for the "Load Dividend Information" feature. This feature is aimed at enhancing our home-use web app by providing users with timely and accurate dividend data. Your guidance will be instrumental in ensuring Jamie can create a spec that's not only clear and comprehensive but also actionable and aligned with our incremental development approach.

**Hereâ€™s how to refine your guidance for Jamie:**

1. **Clarify the Feature's Scope and Purpose**: Start by reinforcing the significance of the "Load Dividend Information" feature for our home users. Highlight the feature's goal to improve user engagement and decision-making regarding their investments.

2. **Detail the Use of the 'Book'**: Instruct Jamie on how to effectively leverage the "book" for this task. Encourage her to extract relevant information on our app's current functionalities, data handling practices, and user interface guidelines that could influence the integration of this new feature.

3. **Simplify and Specify**: Given our focus on home use, advise Jamie to maintain simplicity in her design and implementation plan. Request that she breaks down the feature into smaller, testable components, outlining specific steps for development and integration into the existing app framework.

4. **Encourage Detailed Documentation**: Emphasize the importance of documenting each step of the spec development process. Guide Jamie to note any assumptions, questions, and particularly any areas where the "book" may lack sufficient detail or clarity.

5. **Promote an Incremental and Testable Approach**: Stress the need for Jamie to outline the spec in a way that allows for incremental development and testing. Each component of the feature should be defined with clear objectives and criteria for success, facilitating easier testing and validation.

**End Note**:

"Jamie, by following these refined instructions and using the 'book' as your foundational resource, you're well-equipped to draft a comprehensive and actionable spec for the 'Load Dividend Information' feature. Your ability to detail each step, maintain simplicity, and ensure testability will be crucial in bringing this valuable feature to our users effectively. I look forward to seeing the innovative solutions you come up with."
