### High-Level Specification: Ingestion of PDF Information

**Objective**: To extract, parse, validate, and store trade information from PDF reports generated by Interactive Brokers into the trades database of the web application.

**Scope**:
- This process involves reading PDF documents, extracting relevant trade data, validating this data by calculating and confirming profit/loss figures, and integrating this data into an existing database system.

**Functional Requirements**:

1. **PDF Data Extraction**:
   - Ability to read PDF files and extract textual content.
   - Identify and parse relevant sections containing trade data.

2. **Data Parsing and Structuring**:
   - Convert raw text data into a structured format (e.g., list of trade objects).
   - Each trade object should capture details such as trade date, type, quantity, and price.

3. **Data Validation and Confirmation**:
   - Calculate profit/loss for each extracted trade and aggregate these for all trades.
   - Verify the aggregated profit/loss against the totals reported in the PDF to ensure data integrity.

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Insert the validated trades into the trades database table.
   - Ensure that data insertion respects the database schema and integrity constraints.

5. **User Interface and Interaction**:
   - Provide a user interface for file upload and initiate the PDF ingestion process.
   - Display extracted trades and calculated profit/loss for user confirmation.
   - Allow users to accept the data or report discrepancies.

6. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Ensure secure handling and storage of sensitive financial data.
   - Implement error handling and logging for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- **Performance**: The system should process a standard PDF report within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., less than a minute).
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and guide the user through the PDF ingestion process.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle varying sizes and formats of PDF files without degradation in performance.
- **Security**: Implement best practices in data security, especially concerning the handling of sensitive financial information.

**Technologies to be used**:
- Backend processing: Python (libraries such as `pdfplumber` for PDF parsing).
- Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS (frameworks like React or Angular if applicable).
- Database: SQL-based database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- Security: Secure file handling, data encryption, and secure API design.

Milestones: Test-Driven Development Approach
Requirement Gathering and Specification

Clarify and document the requirements for the PDF ingestion feature, focusing on the specific data to be extracted, validated, and stored.
Define the acceptance criteria for each requirement to guide the testing and development process.
Design and Architecture Planning

Design the overall architecture of the solution, considering how the PDF reading, parsing, validation, and database integration will interact.
Plan the structure of the database and data models based on the expected data format.
Test Case Development

Develop comprehensive test cases before writing the actual code (following the TDD principles).
Include unit tests for each component (PDF extraction, data parsing, profit/loss calculation, data validation).
Create integration tests to ensure components work together seamlessly.
Prepare mock PDF files and define expected outputs for testing.
Implementation of PDF Data Extraction

Implement the functionality to read and extract raw data from PDF files.
Continuously run and refine unit tests to ensure the extraction meets the predefined test cases.
Implementation of Data Parsing

Develop the parsing logic to transform raw PDF text into structured data.
Adjust unit tests as needed and ensure the parser accurately processes the test inputs according to expectations.
Implementation of Data Validation and Profit/Loss Calculation

Code the logic for validating parsed data and calculating profit/loss.
Execute and refine the corresponding tests to verify calculations and validations against expected results.
Database Integration

Set up database schemas and write the code for integrating parsed data into the database.
Ensure integration tests validate the entire flow from PDF ingestion to database storage.
User Interface Development

Develop the user interface for uploading PDFs, initiating the ingestion process, and displaying results for user confirmation.
Implement functional tests to ensure the UI handles inputs and interacts with backend processes correctly.
End-to-End Testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end tests to validate the entire workflow under simulated real-world conditions.
Perform UAT with stakeholders to ensure the system meets business needs and user expectations.
Deployment and Monitoring

Deploy the feature in a production environment.
Monitor the system for issues and gather user feedback for further refinement.
