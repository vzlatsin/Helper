### Write Detailed Specifications:
- **Action:** Write detailed specifications that outline goals, constraints, and user interactions.
- **Details:** Make sure specifications are straightforward for the developer to follow.

The specifications will be developed based on the sub-roadmap. Let me provide specifications for the Closed Lists and Backlog features step by step. 

### Closed Lists
1. **Objective:**
   - Provide a way to organize daily tasks into unmodifiable lists that users can work on and complete within a day.
  
2. **User Interface:**
   - An intuitive page where users can add tasks to their daily Closed List.
   - Option to view, analyze, and archive completed lists.

3. **Backend Logic:**
   - Ensure that once the day starts, the list cannot be modified.
   - Store daily lists in a way that preserves their immutability.
   - Provide a method to retrieve archived lists for analysis.

4. **Constraints:**
   - Lists should be reset daily.
   - Each task must be unique to prevent duplication.

### Backlog
1. **Objective:**
   - Create a backlog section where users can add tasks that do not fit into the daily list, enabling them to prioritize and later move them into the daily Closed Lists.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Separate page or tab where users can add, prioritize, and edit tasks in their backlog.
   - Mechanism to move tasks from the backlog to the daily Closed Lists.

3. **Backend Logic:**
   - Allow flexible addition and prioritization of tasks.
   - Support task categorization or tagging for better organization.

4. **Constraints:**
   - Backlog tasks should be able to be reordered without constraints.
   - Ensure tasks are easily editable and can be moved or copied into daily lists.
