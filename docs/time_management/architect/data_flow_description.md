### Data Flow Design



1. **Data Entry**
   - Users enter tasks through a user interface.
   - Tasks can be added to "Today's List" or the "Backlog".
   - Each task entry includes description, scheduled date (optional for backlog), and priority.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Tasks entered for "Today" are added to the Closed Lists, which are immutable once the day starts.
   - Tasks can be moved from the Backlog to Today's List based on user action.
   - Tasks are marked as completed or archived by the user.

3. **Data Storage**
   - All task data are stored in a relational database with tables as outlined in the database schema design.
   - Tasks are indexed by Task ID for quick retrieval, with secondary indexing on Scheduled Date and Status for efficient querying.

4. **Data Output**
   - Users view tasks on different interfaces based on their status: Today's List, Backlog, and Archived Tasks.
   - The system generates reports on task completion rates and other analytics as required.


### Review and Approval
This initial data flow plan needs to be reviewed to ensure it covers all aspects of data management adequately and meets your specific requirements. Adjustments can be made based on your feedback to better align with the operational needs and technical constraints of the application.
