### Data Requirements Document for Time Management Feature

**1. Core Data Types**
- **Tasks**: Each task will have attributes such as:
  - Description: Textual content describing the task.
  - Creation Date: The date on which the task was created.
  - Scheduled Date: The date the task is scheduled to be completed.
  - Status: Indicates if the task is planned for today ('Today'), scheduled for tomorrow ('Tomorrow'), or is part of a future list ('Future').

**2. Data Relationships**
- **Task and Date Association**: Tasks are linked to specific dates, important for managing "closed lists" where tasks cannot be added after the day begins.
- **Task Sequencing**: Allows for ordering and reordering of tasks within a day based on user interactions.

**3. Data Storage**
- **Tasks Table**: A new table specifically designed to store task information will include:
  - Task ID (unique identifier)
  - Description
  - Creation Date
  - Scheduled Date
  - Status

**4. Security and Privacy**
- Basic security measures will be implemented, with potential for encryption if tasks include sensitive data.

**5. Data Volume and Management**
- The data is expected to be low volume, with simple management through a relational database suitable for the application's scale.

**6. Data Export and Integration**
- Basic export functionalities such as CSV for backups or simple data transfers will be included.

**7. Additional Features**
- **Backlog Management**: Management of tasks not yet scheduled for specific days.
- **Review and Planning**: Features to review past tasks and plan for upcoming days, essential for adhering to the "Do It Tomorrow" methodology.
