# Closed Lists Specification

## Overview
The "Closed Lists" feature allows users to create a daily list of tasks that remains fixed throughout the day, encouraging focus and reducing distractions. The feature aligns with the principles of "Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management" by Mark Forster.

## Purpose
The goal of the Closed Lists feature is to help users:
1. Focus on a predetermined set of tasks each day.
2. Avoid the stress of last-minute or reactive task additions.
3. Encourage daily planning and prioritization.

## Features

### 1. Daily Task List
- Users should be able to create a daily task list at the start of each day.
- The task list should include options for setting priorities and deadlines.

### 2. Task Locking
- Once the day begins, the task list should be locked, preventing further modifications.
- Users should be notified that the list is locked when they attempt to make changes.

### 3. Daily Planning
- The feature should include a prompt or reminder for planning the next day's tasks at the end of each day.
- Users should have the ability to review and finalize the next day's tasks before locking the list.

### 4. Notifications
- Users should receive a notification when their list is about to be locked for the day.
- Reminders should prompt users to finalize their list at the start of the day and before the end of the previous day.
