### Sub-Roadmap for Time Management Feature

**Phase 1: Initial Setup**
1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Create project directories and initialize version control.
   - Define coding standards and project conventions.
   - Setup initial configurations for development environment.
2. **Database Design**
   - Design database schema for time management (tasks, reminders, lists).
   - Implement database models and migrations.
   - Setup development database and seed initial data.

**Phase 2: Backend Development**
1. **API Development**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for task management:
     - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve a list of tasks.
     - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
     - `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Update a specific task.
     - `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Delete a specific task.
   - Implement endpoints for list management:
     - `GET /lists`: Retrieve a list of task lists.
     - `POST /lists`: Create a new task list.
     - `PUT /lists/{id}`: Update a specific task list.
     - `DELETE /lists/{id}`: Delete a specific task list.
   - Implement endpoints for reminders:
     - `GET /reminders`: Retrieve a list of reminders.
     - `POST /reminders`: Create a new reminder.
     - `PUT /reminders/{id}`: Update a specific reminder.
     - `DELETE /reminders/{id}`: Delete a specific reminder.
2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement user authentication using JWT.
   - Secure API endpoints with role-based access control.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development**
1. **UI Design**
   - Create wireframes and mockups for task management interface.
   - Define UX flow for creating, editing, and viewing tasks, lists, and reminders.
2. **Component Development**
   - Develop reusable UI components:
     - Task List Component: Display a list of tasks.
     - Task Item Component: Display individual task details.
     - Task Form Component: Form to create/edit tasks.
   - Develop list management components:
     - List Component: Display a list of task lists.
     - List Item Component: Display individual list details.
     - List Form Component: Form to create/edit lists.
   - Integrate calendar for task scheduling:
     - Use a calendar library (e.g., FullCalendar) to display tasks and reminders.
   - Implement reminder and notification features.

**Phase 4: Testing and Debugging**
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for backend components using pytest.
   - Write unit tests for frontend components using Jest.
2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the interaction between frontend and backend components.
3. **Debugging**
   - Identify and resolve bugs and issues found during testing.

**Phase 5: Documentation and Deployment**
1. **Documentation**
   - Document API endpoints using tools like Swagger.
   - Write user guides for frontend components.
   - Maintain a changelog of updates and bug fixes.
2. **Deployment**
   - Setup deployment pipelines for continuous integration and delivery.
   - Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
   - Deploy to production environment.
